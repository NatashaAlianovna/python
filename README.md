Hi, this program is created to store bitcoin addresses with balance only for educational and entertainment purposes.
I investigate the elliptic curve and its development in bitcoin and other currencies, I think that sooner or later the addresses that start with 1 will be obsolete due to the advance of brute force technology.

Utilities of the program:
- Search for an address in the database.
- Delete an address.
- Sort the database.
- Check the balance of an address.
- Check an exa at address.

I will be modifying it to be able to add new functions and improve errors.
If you liked my code, I know my favorite language but I will do my best to improve it, you can contribute with code improvements.
Enjoy the programming.
